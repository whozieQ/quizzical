# Quizzical

## A Solo React project by Susan Briggs

At the conclusion of the React Basics module we were challenged to work solo to create a quiz-type app using the React basics we had learned.

Key requirements include:
1. Follow Figma guidelines found here: https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App?node-id=0%3A1 (but feel free to put your own spin on it)
2. Leverage the OTDB API to pull trivia questions
3. Use a separate 'start' screen that lets the user click a button to start the quiz
4. Use a separate 'questions' screen that displays 5 trivia questions, lets the user choose answers to each, and click a button to check their answers
5. Update the questions screen to show correct answers and a score. 
6. Let the user click a button to play again.
